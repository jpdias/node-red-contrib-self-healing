  <p>A node that checks if an action was completed</p>
  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of this node is to confirm an action performed by an actuator,
    in a given time frame, by the use of acknowledgements provided by sensors
    that can confirm the occurence of that action. If an action is sent to the
    node, and an acknowledgement is sent during a given time to live, then the
    node concludes that the action was successful. Otherwise, an error message
    is sent.
  </p>
  <h3>Properties</h3>
  <dl class="message-properties">
    <dt>name<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
    <dd>name of node to be displayed in editor</dd>

    <dt>duration<span class="property-type">integer</span></dt>
    <dd>An action's max duration to be checked on, in seconds</dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Inputs</h3>
  <dl class="message-properties">
    A message should have exactly one of the following properties:

    <dt>action</dt>
    <dd>The description of an action or any data for a given action</dd>

    <dt>ack</dt>
    <dd>
      An aknowledgement to the action that was sent first and still not
      acknowledged
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Outputs</h3>
  <dl class="message-properties">
    <p>
      If the first queued action is acknowledged, then it's retransmitted
      through the success output, otherwise it's retransmitted through the error
      output. In case of an unexpected situation, such as a receiving an ACK
      with no queued actions, it's sent through a third exception output.
    </p>
  </dl>
